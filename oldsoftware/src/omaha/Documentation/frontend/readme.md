		This documentation was generated using the documentation_maker.py script located in omaha/Documentation.
		</br>
		The script strips out the script part of the .html files and re-saves them as .html.js in the omaha/Documentation/rawjs folder. 
		</br>
		JSDoc then takes this folder and the files in it and parses through them to figure out the comments and displays them with the functions that they belong to.
		</br>

		If you want to modify a file, DO NOT make the modification to the .html.js files; this will have no effect on the website as these files are created purely for documentation purposes. Modify the corresponding file located in omaha/templates/components.
